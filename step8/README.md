# A Better/Easier Way of Taking Inputs from User


### Open any text editor (Notepad, Sublime text)
And write the following code

```python
age = input("How old are you? ")
height = input("How tall are you? ")
weight = input("How much do you weigh? ")
print(f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall and {weight} heavy.")
```
Save the file as `taking_user_inputs1.py`
You can name the file anything, but the extension must be `.py`
## Run the program
Open cmd and go to the location where you have saved the file and run:
```bash
 python taking_user_inputs1.py
```

## You should see some statements printed on your cmd
```bash
How old are you?
20
How tall are you?
5 ft
How much do you weigh?
50kg
So, you're 20 old, 5 ft tall and 50kg heavy.
```
