# Comments in Python

## About Comments in Programming Language
Comments are very important in your programs. They are used to tell you what something does in
English, and they are used to disable parts of your program if you need to remove them temporarily.
Hereâ€™s how you use comments in Python:

### Open any text editor (Notepad, Sublime text)
And write the following code

```python
# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print("I could have code like this.") # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out code:
# print("This won't run.")
print("This will run.")
```
Save the file as `comments.py`
You can name the file anything, but the extension must be `.py`
## Run the program
Open cmd and go to the location where you have saved the file and run:
```bash
 python comments.py
```

## You should see some statements printed on your cmd
```bash
I could have code like this.
This will run.
```
