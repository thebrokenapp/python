# First Python Program

## Printing
Printing is used for logging, debugging and checking the flow of the code as to how it is getting executed

### Open any text editor (Notepad, Sublime text)
And write the following code

```python
print("Hello World!")
print("Hello Again")
print("I like typing this.")
print("This is fun.")
print('Yay! Printing.')
print("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
print('I "said" do not touch this.')
```
Save the file as `app.py`
You can name the file anything, but the extension must be `.py`
## Run the program
Open cmd and go to the location where you have saved the file and run:
```bash
 python app.py
```

## You should see some statements printed on your cmd
```bash
Hello World!
Hello Again
I like typing this.
This is fun.
Yay! Printing.
I'd much rather you 'not'.
I "said" do not touch this.
```
